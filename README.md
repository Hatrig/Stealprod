<h1>Stealprod</h1>

The source code of the web part of the stealprod project. 

Written in PHP.

I am publishing this project as I no longer own it and no longer work on it. Besides, the given code is outdated, written, in my opinion - bad. This was my first project and my first experience in writing projects on PHP.

Special thanks to Barspinoff, for his participation in the project. This project would not have been possible without his participation.
